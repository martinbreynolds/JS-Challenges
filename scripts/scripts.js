// The Age Calculator

// Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

// Store the current year in a variable.
// Store their birth year in a variable.
// Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
// Output them to the screen like so: “They are either NN or NN”, substituting the values.

// The Fortune Teller
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables:

// number of children
// partner’s name
// geographic location
// job title
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: “You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids.”
